        Parchment paper helps the cakes seamlessly release from the pans. (If
        it's helpful, see this

      <li>
        <strong>Make the cake:</strong> Whisk the flour, cocoa powder, sugar,
        baking soda, baking powder, salt, and espresso powder (if using)
        together in a large bowl. Set aside. Using a handheld or stand mixer
        fitted with a whisk attachment (or you can use a whisk) mix the oil,
        eggs, and vanilla together on medium-high speed until combined. Add the
        buttermilk and mix until combined. Pour the wet ingredients into the dry
        ingredients, add the hot water/coffee, and whisk or beat on low speed
        until the batter is completely combined. Batter is thin.
      </li>
      <li>
        Divide batter evenly between pans. Bake for 23-26 minutes or until a
        toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. Baking times vary, so
        keep an eye on yours. The cakes are done when a toothpick inserted in
        the center comes out clean. (<strong>Note:</strong>> Even if they’re
        completely done, the cooled cakes may *slightly* sink in the center.
        Cocoa powder is simply not as structurally strong as all-purpose flour
        and can’t hold up to all the moisture necessary to make a moist tasting
        chocolate cake. It’s normal!)
      </li>
      <li>
        Remove the cakes from the oven and set on a wire rack. Allow to cool
        completely in the pan.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Make the buttercream:</strong>> With a handheld or stand mixer
        fitted with a paddle attachment, beat the butter on medium speed until
        creamy – about 2 minutes. Add confectioners’ sugar, cocoa powder, 3
        Tablespoons heavy cream, salt, and vanilla extract. Beat on low speed
        for 30 seconds, then increase to high speed and beat for 1 full minute.
        Do not over-whip. Add 1/4 cup more confectioners’ sugar or cocoa powder
        if frosting is too thin or 1-2 more Tablespoons of cream if frosting is
        too thick. (I usually add 1 more.) Taste. Add another pinch of salt if
        desired.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Assemble and frost:</strong> If cooled cakes are domed on top,
        use a large serrated knife to slice a thin layer off the tops to create
        a flat surface. This is called “leveling” the cakes. Discard or crumble
        over finished cake. Place 1 cake layer on your cake stand or serving
        plate. Evenly cover the top with frosting. Top with 2nd layer and spread
        remaining frosting all over the top and sides. I always use an

        Refrigerate uncovered cake for at least 30-60 minutes before slicing to
        help set the shape. After that, you can serve the cake or continue
        refrigerating for up to 4–6 hours before serving. Cake can be served at
        room temperature or chilled.
